          Welcome to myReads! This project respresents the culmination of my
          work in the Code Louisville program. For this project, I decided that
          I wanted to create an app that would allow users to create lists of
          books they plan to read, as well as query the Library of Congress
          database for additional materials.

      <div class="two">
        <h3><a href="bookList.html">Book List</a></h3>
        <p class="text-light">
          Create a list of books! This list is saved to your local storage, so
          you won't have to worry about losing your results when you close your
          browser window. Just be sure not to clear that cache!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="three">
        <h3><a href="bookSearch.html">Search the LOC</a></h3>
        <p class="text-light">
          This tool allows you to query the books catalog of the Library of
          Congress. What is unique about this database is that it contains more
          than just books. It contains maybe different types of print materials
          that can include scans of portraits, court decisions, and much more!

      <div class="four">
        <p class="text-light">
          I was inspired to create this project by my past experience as a
          research assistant and time in graduate school. When starting on a new
          project, you often find yourself with a scrap of paper with a dozen or
          so call numbers. Univserity libraries use the same cataloging system
          as the Library of Congress (LOC), which means books are shelved
          according to subject matter. What this means is that you often find
          the most interesting titles on your subject without even meaning to!
          This process of discovery in research is vital. To get started, click
          "Search LOC" above and starting searching the stacks! And don't worry,
          the search is restricted to digitaized materials only, so you don't
          even have to go to the library to pull your first text.
